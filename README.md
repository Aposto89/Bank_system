# Bank_system
This a project that shows the integration between Python and MySQL.

There are two files:

bank_project.py
Bank_project.sql
First we have to create the database with MySQL. The sample database name is "new_bank". Our database contains two tables and the information that we put in the Python project would be directy populated in the both tables(Accounts and Amount). We use the Python project to accumulated the information for the existed database.

The data for connection between python project and the SQL database, have to be updated:

host="localhost".
user="root".
password="type you password".
database="new_bank".
Before lauching the python file, we have to be sure the the information in the python script is updated accurately.
